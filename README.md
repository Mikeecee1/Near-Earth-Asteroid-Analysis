# Near Earth Asteroid Analysis ü™ê 

### Project Overview

This project explores NASA‚Äôs Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset, focusing on asteroids that come within close proximity to Earth.
Using publicly available data from NASA‚Äôs JPL Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects), this analysis investigates the physical and orbital characteristics that influence whether an asteroid is classified as potentially hazardous.

## Dataset Content
* The dataset includes key attributes such as estimated diameter, relative velocity, miss distance, and absolute magnitude of over 27000 asteroids with 90000 observations.
Additional features have been added (based upon the original data). For example number of observations per object, was engineered to capture tracking frequency and observation density.



## Business Requirements

The requirements of the project are to:
* Identify potentially dangerous asteroids
* Investigate which physical properties contribute to hazardous status
* Understanding these properties may help to mitigate the threats posed

Hazardous asteroids may:
* Be a direct threat to earth if large enough
* Disrupt communications and other satellites
* Be a threat to other near earth objects e.g. space telescopes



## **Hypothesis and how to validate?**

The hypotheses for this project are as follows:
* **Physical and Predictive Hypotheses** üöÄ
    * **Larger asteroids** (greater estimated diameters) are more likely to be classified as hazardous.
        * **Validation**
            1. Compare diameter distributions between hazardous vs non-hazardous objects with a boxplot / violin plot.
            2. Run a two-sample test (Mann‚ÄìWhitney U if non-normal, t-test if approx normal) to check median/mean differences.
            3. Fit a simple logistic regression: is_hazardous ~ log(diameter). Check coefficient sign, p-value, and AUC.
        * **Supportive result**: Hazardous group has significantly larger diameters (p < 0.05) and positive diameter coefficient in logistic regression with meaningful effect size

    * **Closer approaches to Earth** (smaller miss distances) are associated with a higher likelihood of hazard classification.
        * **Validation**
            1. Visualize miss distance distributions by hazard status
            2. Use Mann‚ÄìWhitney U or t-test for distance differences.
            3. Logistic regression
        * **Supportive result**: Hazardous asteroids concentrate at smaller miss distances (statistically significant) and miss_distance has a negative, significant logistic coefficient.

    * **Higher relative velocities** correlate with greater hazard potential due to increased impact energy.
        * **Validation**
            1. Plot velocity distributions by hazard status.
            2. Statistical test (Mann‚ÄìWhitney U / t-test).
            3. Logistic regression
        * **Supportive result**: Hazardous objects show significantly higher relative velocities
    * **Absolute magnitude** (brightness) inversely correlates with hazard level ‚Äî brighter (larger) objects are more likely to be hazardous. 
        * **Validation**
            1. Visualize H by hazard status.
            2. Test difference with Mann‚ÄìWhitney U / t-test.
            3. Logistic regression: hazardous ~ -absolute_magnitude (or use H and expect negative coefficient)
        * **Supportive result**: Supportive result: Hazardous asteroids have lower median H (statistical significance) and H coefficient indicates brighter objects increase hazard odds.

    * A combination of **size**, **speed**, and **miss distance** can effectively predict hazard status.
        * **Validation**
            1. Train a multivariate classifier (logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost) using those features.
            2. Use cross-validation and report AUC, precision, recall, and calibration (reliability plot).
            3. Run ablation: compare model using all three vs models using subsets 
        * **Supportive result**: upportive result: Multivariate model achieves substantially higher AUC (e.g., >0.80 if baseline is ~0.5‚Äì0.6) and ablation shows each feature contributes measurable lift.

*  **Observational Hypotheses** üî≠
    * NEOs with more recorded **observations** tend to be closer and larger.
        * **Validation**
            1. Scatter plots: observation_count vs miss_distance and observation_count vs diameter (use log scales).
            2. Compute Spearman correlation (robust to nonlinearity) for observation_count with miss_distance and with diameter.
            3. Regress observation_count (or log count) on miss_distance and diameter to quantify effects.
        * **Supportive result**: Negative Spearman for observation_count vs miss_distance, positive Spearman vs diameter (both significant).

    * **Potentially hazardous asteroids** are observed more frequently due to higher monitoring priority.
        * * **Validation**
            1. Compare observation_count distributions by hazard status (boxplot/histogram).
            2. Mann‚ÄìWhitney U / t-test to check difference.
            3. Poisson or negative binomial regression: observation_count ~ is_hazardous + controls (e.g., discovery_year) to estimate incidence rate ratio..
        * **Supportive result**: Hazardous objects have higher median observation counts and hazard indicator has a positive, significant rate ratio.

    * There is a positive correlation between the number of **observations** and an asteroid‚Äôs **brightness** or **size**.
        * **Validation**
            1. Calculate Spearman correlations for observation_count vs H and observation_count vs diameter.
            2. Visualize with binned summaries (median diameter per log observation_count bin).
            3. 
        * **Supportive result**: Positive correlation with diameter and negative correlation with H (remembering H scale), both significant.


    * (*Note: H = Absolute Magnitude, scale direction: lower H = brighter/larger* )



## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Ethical considerations
* Privacy and personal data
    * The dataset is astronomical and does not contain personal data.
* There are few ethical or societal issues regarding this project.
    * Legal and ethical consderations would be covered by the [Space Treaty](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html) under the governance of the UN.
* Dual use and misuse
    * Near-Earth object (NEO) analysis could inform planetary defense policy or, in theory, be misused in other contexts - e.g. exploitation of resources, misinformation regarding threat (sensationlism).
However, this project is an exploration of already existing and publicly available data and is unlikely to pose any ethical issues.

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.
