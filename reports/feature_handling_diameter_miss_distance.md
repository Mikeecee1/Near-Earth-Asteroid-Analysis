Best practices: Handling multiple diameter and miss_distance features for modelling

Short summary

Keep multiple summary features (mean/min/max/range) when they capture different signal, but treat them carefully — check correlation, reduce redundancy, transform/skew-correct, and validate with ablation. Use model-appropriate preprocessing (log + scaling for linear models; trees tolerate raw) and run systematic feature‑importance/ablation to confirm you’re adding signal, not noise.

Why this matters

Diameter and miss-distance naturally produce several summaries per object (mean, min, max, range). Each can carry different meaning:
- mean = typical size/approach,
- min = closest approach (safety-critical),
- max = potential outlier size,
- range = measurement/shape variability (uncertainty signal).

But these summaries are often highly correlated. Feeding many highly‑collinear features into some models (especially linear ones) can inflate variance, reduce interpretability, and make coefficients unstable.

Practical approach (step-by-step)

1) Keep originals; create clear derived columns
- Keep raw columns and add derived ones you think are meaningful (example set):
  - est_diameter_mean, est_diameter_min, est_diameter_max, est_diameter_range
  - miss_distance_mean, miss_distance_min, miss_distance_max (if available), miss_distance_range
- Also add safe transforms: *_log1p for any skewed non-negative field.

2) Quick diagnostics (before modelling)
- Correlation matrix (Spearman) for the diameter and miss_distance family.
- Compute VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to spot collinearity for linear methods.
- Check skew and ranges; inspect pairwise scatterplots.

3) Preprocessing by model class
- Linear models (logistic regression, GLMs)
  - Use log1p on skewed features.
  - Standardize (StandardScaler) after log transform.
  - Remove or combine highly collinear features (VIF > 5–10).
  - Use regularization (L1 for feature selection, L2 to stabilize).
- Tree-based models (random forest, XGBoost)
  - Trees are robust to scale and some collinearity — you can include correlated summaries.
  - Still useful to provide log versions to show different splits/thresholds.
- Pipelines: always build sklearn Pipeline/ColumnTransformer so transforms are reproducible and applied inside CV.

4) Feature strategies to try (experiment matrix)
- Minimal set: {est_diameter_mean, miss_distance_min, relative_velocity_mean, absolute_magnitude_mean}
- Expanded set: add est_diameter_range and miss_distance_mean (test if they add value)
- Log-expanded: use log1p versions for linear models
- Interaction features: diameter_mean * relative_velocity_mean (kinetic proxy), or diameter_mean / miss_distance_min
- Uncertainty features: include range (diameter_range) — may be predictive of measurement uncertainty or interest
- Dimensionality reduction: if many derived stats, use PCA on the diameter group and/or miss_distance group (retain components explaining e.g. 95% variance) — useful when you have many correlated summaries.

5) Model evaluation and feature validation
- Use stratified cross-validation.
- Compare models and feature sets with consistent metrics: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC (for class imbalance), calibration.
- Run ablation: remove a group (e.g., all diameter_range features) and measure performance drop.
- Use permutation feature importance or SHAP values to check whether a feature actually contributes to predictions.
- If a feature consistently has low importance or harms CV performance, drop it.

6) Rules-of-thumb
- If a diameter/min or miss_distance_min is strongly predictive (high importance), keep it even if correlated.
- If range adds no incremental performance or is redundant with mean/min, drop it for simplicity.
- Prefer keeping both mean and min for domain reasons: min captures extreme risk; mean captures typical size.

7) Handling multicollinearity (if you care about coefficients)
- For interpretability/regression coefficients:
  - Use L1 (Lasso) to select among correlated features, or
  - Use PCA on the correlated group and interpret components (less interpretable), or
  - Keep one representative (e.g., mean for central tendency, min for extreme) chosen by domain reasoning and tests.
- Report VIF and mention mitigations in notebook/README.

8) Edge cases & pitfalls
- Leakage: don’t use future/derived features that leak target information (not likely here if aggregation is per-object from historical observations).
- Zero/negative values: use log1p for zeros; for negatives use Yeo–Johnson or shift with explanation.
- Class imbalance: prefer PR-AUC and calibration plots in addition to ROC.

9) Example (sketch) sklearn pipeline for a linear model

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer, StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score
import numpy as np

log1p = FunctionTransformer(np.log1p, validate=False)

diameter_cols = ['est_diameter_mean','est_diameter_min','est_diameter_range']
miss_cols = ['miss_distance_min','miss_distance_mean']
num_cols = diameter_cols + miss_cols + ['relative_velocity_mean','absolute_magnitude_mean']
to_log = ['est_diameter_mean','est_diameter_range','miss_distance_mean','miss_distance_min','relative_velocity_mean']

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('log_scale', Pipeline([('log', log1p), ('scaler', StandardScaler())]), to_log),
    ('others', StandardScaler(), list(set(num_cols) - set(to_log)))
], remainder='drop')

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('pre', preprocessor),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', class_weight='balanced', max_iter=1000))
])

cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, cv=cv, scoring='roc_auc')
```

10) Interpretability & production
- Use SHAP for tree models and permutation importance for model-agnostic checks.
- Log chosen final feature set and the reason (performance/interpretability) — keep originals in processed data for audit.

Acceptance checklist for starting modelling
- [ ] Diagnostics run: correlation, VIF, skew for diameter and miss_distance features.
- [ ] Candidate feature sets defined (minimal, expanded, log-transformed).
- [ ] Pipelines prepared for both linear and tree models.
- [ ] CV + ablation plan defined and executed; decisions logged.
- [ ] Interpretability checks (feature importances/SHAP) confirm retained features add signal.

Bottom line
- Multiple summaries for diameter/miss_distance are fine and often helpful — they capture different aspects (typical vs extreme vs uncertainty). But don’t blindly include all of them without testing. Use diagnostics, regularization/ablation, and model‑appropriate preprocessing to ensure they add predictive value rather than noise.
