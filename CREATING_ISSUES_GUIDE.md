# Creating GitHub Issues - Step by Step Guide

This guide will help you create all 30+ GitHub issues for the Near-Earth Asteroid Analysis project.

## Before You Start

1. **Create Labels First** - Set up the recommended labels in your GitHub repository
2. **Review the Plan** - Read through PROJECT_PLAN.md to understand the project structure
3. **Allocate Time** - Creating all issues will take approximately 30-45 minutes

## Recommended GitHub Labels

Go to your repository → Issues → Labels → New Label, and create:

### Phase Labels
- `phase-1` (color: #0E8A16) - Phase 1 ETL
- `phase-2` (color: #1D76DB) - Phase 2 Visualization & Stats
- `phase-3` (color: #5319E7) - Phase 3 Machine Learning

### Cross-Cutting Concerns (4 issues)
26. Project Documentation
27. Code Quality and Standards
28. Version Control and Collaboration
29. Environment and Dependency Management

## Quick Issue Creation Steps

For each issue:

1. **Go to Issues** → Click "New Issue"
2. **Copy Template** - From GITHUB_ISSUES_TEMPLATES.md
3. **Paste Content** - Into the issue description
4. **Add Title** - Use the exact title from the template
5. **Add Labels** - Apply appropriate labels (phase, category, priority)
6. **Add to Project** - If using GitHub Projects (optional)
7. **Assign** - Assign to team members if known (optional)
8. **Create Issue** - Click "Submit new issue"

## Batch Creation Tips

### Option 1: Manual Creation (Recommended for small teams)
- Create issues one by one
- Take breaks every 5-10 issues
- Double-check labels and assignments
- Estimated time: 30-45 minutes

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (For faster creation)
If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create issues faster:

```bash
gh issue create --title "[ETL] Data Source Identification and Access" \
  --body "$(cat issue_template_1.txt)" \
  --label "etl,phase-1,high-priority"
```

### Option 3: GitHub API/Scripts (Advanced)
For teams that want automation, consider creating a script to batch-create issues from the templates.

## Issue Template Example

Here's what a complete issue should look like:

**Title:** `[ETL] Data Source Identification and Access`

**Labels:** `etl`, `phase-1`, `high-priority`

**Body:**
```
Identify and gain access to Near-Earth Asteroid datasets from reliable sources (e.g., NASA's JPL, Minor Planet Center, or Kaggle datasets).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research available NEA datasets
- [ ] Identify primary data source(s)
- [ ] Set up API access or download permissions
- [ ] Document data source(s) in README
- [ ] Create data dictionary with field descriptions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data source(s) identified and accessible
- Data dictionary documented
- Initial raw data downloaded

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
```

## Organizing Issues

### Using GitHub Projects (Optional but Recommended)

1. Create a new Project Board
2. Create columns:
   - Backlog
   - To Do
   - In Progress
   - In Review
   - Done

3. Add all created issues to the project
4. Organize issues by phase or priority
5. Move issues through columns as work progresses

### Using Milestones

Create milestones for each phase:
- **Phase 1: ETL** (Due: Week 4)
- **Phase 2: Visualization & Stats** (Due: Week 8)
- **Phase 3: Machine Learning** (Due: Week 12)
- **Phase 4: Power BI Dashboard** (Due: Week 16)

Assign issues to appropriate milestones.

## Issue Dependencies

Some issues depend on others. Note these dependencies in issue comments:

**Example dependencies:**
- Issue #2 (Raw Data Extraction) depends on #1 (Data Source Identification)
- Issue #3 (Data Quality Assessment) depends on #2 (Raw Data Extraction)
- Issue #4 (Data Cleaning) depends on #3 (Data Quality Assessment)
- Issue #9 (Model Data Prep) depends on #5 (Feature Engineering)

You can reference dependencies in GitHub using:
```
Depends on #1
Blocks #3
```

## Tracking Progress

### Daily Updates
- Update issue status when you start working on it
- Check off tasks as you complete them
- Add comments with progress updates

### Weekly Reviews
- Review all issues in current phase
- Update estimates if needed
- Identify blockers
- Adjust priorities as needed

### End of Phase
- Ensure all phase issues are closed
- Document lessons learned
- Review before moving to next phase

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to create all issues at once?**
A: No, you can create issues phase by phase. However, having them all visible helps with overall project planning.

**Q: Can I modify the templates?**
A: Yes! The templates are starting points. Adapt them to your specific needs.

**Q: What if I discover new tasks during the project?**
A: Create additional issues as needed. The plan is flexible.

**Q: Should I assign all issues immediately?**
A: Only assign issues you're actively working on or planning to work on soon.

**Q: How do I handle blocked issues?**
A: Add a `blocked` label and comment explaining the blocker. Link to the blocking issue.

## After Creating All Issues

1. **Review Issue List** - Ensure all 30+ issues are created
2. **Check Labels** - Verify all issues have appropriate labels
3. **Set Milestones** - Assign issues to milestones
4. **Add to Project** - Add issues to project board
5. **Share with Team** - Notify team members
6. **Start Working** - Begin with Phase 1, Issue #1!

**Pro Tip:** Create one issue from each phase first to ensure your template formatting and labels work correctly, then create the rest in batches.

**Remember:** Issues are living documents. Update them regularly as you work through the project!
